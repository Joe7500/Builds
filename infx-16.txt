The default enforced strong integrity method got patched today. Devices running Infinity-X v3.1+ will fail all 3 integrity checks.

To fix this for now:
1. Download the attached keybox. xml file.
2. Open Infinity Suite > Miscellaneous > Spoofing → Select keybox XML to spoof.
3. Import this keybox.xml file there.

After importing, strong integrity checks will pass again.

A detailed patch to counter this (and any future interventions) will be pushed to the source sometime soon.
